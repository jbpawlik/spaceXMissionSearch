# SpaceX Mission Search

## Description

SpaceX Mission Search combs through the SpaceX database to find missions based on a user search query. The mission search returns several data points like the mission name, ID, year, and a description of the mission. Users can search full or partial words, or leave the search blank to return all missions.

## Technologies Used
SpaceX Mission Search was written in plain JavaScript, React.js, TypeScript, and JSON. It uses the Ionic framework to enable cross-platform use. API calls are made with GraphQL. API responses were tested with Postman.
